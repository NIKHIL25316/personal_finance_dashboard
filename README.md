                Description: Develop a personal finance report using sample data set. The dataset

                Project Objectives:
                1. Clean and organize the data: The raw data might contain inconsistencies, missing values, or
                  errors. Your first task is to clean and prepare the data for analysis. You should do this in a
                  database of your choice.
                2. Analyze the data: Identify key patterns, trends, or insights in the data. You may want to
                  consider factors such as income trends, spending patterns, savings rates, investment returns,
                  and so on. The SQL queries you use need to be part of the final submission.
                3. Develop a personal finance report: Based on your analysis, develop a comprehensive report
                  using a visualization tool of your choice (e.g., Tableau, Power BI, Google Data Studio, etc.). The
                  report should visually present the key findings from your analysis in a clear, intuitive, and
                  engaging manner.
